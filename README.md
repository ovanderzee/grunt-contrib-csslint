This is a fork. Here is the [origin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-contrib-csslint)

### Changes

To me, it's all about the parser-lib of csslint. I changed Grunt-Contrib-CSSlint to pick up my own version of [parser-lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parserlib)

npm install grunt-contrib-csslint-oz to include SVG properties in the CSS linting.
